Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Format classification:
The format of the data can be classified into two types:
* Text (node0, node2, node4)
* JSON (node1, node3)
* None (node5-14)

2. Content classification:

The data is in JSON format, so the answer is: [json]

2. Content classification:
The three types of nodes can be classified as follows:
- node0, node2, node3, and node4 are "movie plot keywords"
- node5, node6, node7, node8, node9, node10, node11, node12, node13, and node14 are "actors"
- node1 is "movie metadata" (specifically, a dictionary containing plot keywords)

So, the answer is: [json, movie plot keywords, actors]

Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Format classification:
The format of the data can be classified into two types:
* Text (node0, node2, node4): These nodes contain a list of keywords separated by pipes (|).
* JSON (node1, node3): These nodes contain a dictionary with a single key-value pair, where the key is 'plot_keywords' and the value is a list of keywords.

2. Content classification:
The content of the nodes can be classified into three types:
* Movie plot keywords (node0, node1, node2, node3, node4): These nodes contain keywords related to the plot of a movie.
* Actor/actress (node5, node6, node7, node8, node9, node10, node11, node12, node13, node14): These nodes contain the names of actors or actresses.
* Director (no nodes): There are no nodes that contain director information.
